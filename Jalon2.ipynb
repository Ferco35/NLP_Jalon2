I loved this place gave, had no problem giving them my money, but when you walk into this new cold feeling yuppie place you will understand, unless you never went before. The prices are sky high probably cause they know yuppies from California have no problem paying them.

He refused to come to the back even though I had already pre paid for the order with my credit card. So I walked down stairs signed for my food and gave the ungrateful driver 15% tips told him if he came to the back door I would've gave him 20%, I didn't mean to be rude I was giving him a pro tip on how to maximize his tips by giving the customer the best experience possible. He goes and swears at me with racial slurs and told me I couldn't get delivery here. I didn't post a review before but today I couldn't even order pick up! ( this was the last straw) The girl at the counter told my girlfriend that she had to come in person and pay for the order at the counter ... Like I was willing to give this place a second chance to change their ways but seems to me that management doesn't care about the customers.

I attempted to call the store 4 times with each call resulting in being hung up on without any answer or taking my call in anyway.  On the 5th call, I was put on hold immediately for several minutes.  When the employee finally answered, I simply asked for someone to drop off the sauce on a delivery run as I live 4 blocks away, it was 90 degrees and 1000% humidity, and it was in fact their mistake.  I was put on hold for several more minutes and then hung up on as I was holding.

For the grand finale - one hour later after being seated - our server apologetically tells us the chef made a seafood paella instead of seafood and chicken. Fine. But for some odd reason, it takes him over ten minutes to bring it out. I thought the chef already made it? When the paella finally comes to our table - it's a big letdown.

My daughter got a veggies sandwich and liked it. I got a BBQ pork sandwich and could not eat it. The meat was tough, fatty and chewy and although I asked for spicy there were few if any jalapenos. It is also far more expensive then the other sandwich shops. I will not go back.\n",

            "If I could give this place a minus that would be the best. DON'T EAT HERE. It's disgusting! The dip has ice in it and was watered down. The burrito was flavorless. The Mexican coke was flat and of course it was in the bottle. I didn't notice the flies until I sat down to eat my food. 1 bite was more than enough for me to throw the whole meal away. I've never had nasty tortilla chips but somehow this place mastered that art too. Save your self and avoid this location.\n",

I would recommend you patronize another store if possible or risk be late to work because u will be in line at least 15 min\n",

            "OK, just got home from a \"birthday\" dinner for my son at the Burlington location. Quick synopsis; he is in the kitchen eating leftover homemade pasta since after two tries, at a steak dinner, they couldn't do it correctly!\n",

            "Details, you want details, here goes...\n",
            " Made a reservation for this evening at 530, making sure to mention that it was a birthday dinner for my son who's turning 17 ( and who has eaten some of the best {& most expensive steaks around...much to my chagrin]) this week. Walked in an was taken to a table that was literally, I think (my first time there, so I'm not 100% certain) the absolute worst one in the room! Told hostess that it wasn't going to work and after some awkward time waiting was taken to a much nicer one. Was offered no apology, but OK, we're on to a nice meal now. Waitress was great, apps were good and after a comfortable, if not a tad lengthy period, dinners arrived. Now for a $44 steak (bone-in Rib-Eye), I must say it was visually appealing, with the bone hanging over the plate by 10 or so inches. The appealing part stops there though! He took a bite or two and I could tell he wasn't happy. He passed a bite or two over and could see why. It wasn't anything what we were expecting. His comment was that he's had better at the 99. I must say, I would have to agree with him ( as did my wife & daughter). When the waitress came over to check on us, we all said our 3 meals were great, but the steak was not one worth anywhere near what we were paying. They offered to get him another meal, and he chose the Filet. By the time the manager (I think it was the manager, she never told us who she was) brought over the new steak, we were done with our meals, so we all held our breath while he cut into the new steak. After ordering two steaks medium, well, I guess you're not going to fall off your chairs when you hear that the outside was nicely charred, while the inside was raw! At that point, he had had enough! Check please! \n",
            "\n",
            " Now, on the plus side, we weren't charged for any steak. We still managed to spend $125 (before tip, which I didn't skimp on because it wasn't the waitresses fault) on the rest of our meals, with a couple of glasses of VERY nice wine. I just feel that at that price level, we were cheated out of my sons birthday dinner and with so many other options in the area, at this level of (supposed) quality(?), there's really no sense in taking a chance going here. Not sure I'd ever go back! Too bad, since it's very convenient for us.\n",
            "\n",
            "UPDATE! - Just wanted to add that I've never heard one word back from the restaurant. After this entry, along with one on their website, not one word. Guess they don't care!\n",
            "Healthier than regular donuts but wayyyyy less tasty. I mean, if you are going to eat a donut, then eat a real donut!! That being said, I know a lot of people that like it. I'm just not one of them.\n",

            "well wanted to give Krystal's another chance, what a big mistake. I order the breakfast plate and everything was wrong... wrong type of eggs, grit when I order Crispers, and a burnt biscuit, when I ordered toast. the manager (Mary) acted like I was burdened and wouldn't even talk to me. she blew me off and walked away. the radio was so loud that we could talk in the store with out shouting. again a went up and ask to speak to the manager and was told sorry corporate controls the music and there is nothing they can do. as of Monday Krystal's lost six long time breakfast club members who will go to steal and shake.\n",
            "sorry. never again. I use to come here often because we live in the neighborhood, but my girlfriend got a sandwich there one day, and we discovered mold on the cheese. never again will I come back here. As a microbiology major, mold on hard cheeses like that run the risk of listeria, brucella, salmonella and E. coli. how long was that cheese open? it has to be refrigerated when not in use right? I have the same cheese in my refrigerator that i have had for three weeks and it doesn't have any mold on it. makes me wonder what the bakery looks like. \n",

An older white couple sat down a few minutes after we did had their orders taken immediately, received their drinks, and even had their request to have a channel changed. All this while a server folded napkins and looked over at us but never came over. As we were walking out, we walked passed one of the servers, which I believe was the manager as well, and she didn't even say a word to us so I just shook my head and kept walking. Hate to do it but might have to play the race card on this one. Sad BS for a place that is supposed to have good customer service.\n",
            "the worst food  i've ever eaten. how do they stay in business???? probably because they are in west roxbury, and people here don't know good restaurants........ greasy food that all looks/tastes the same. the egg rolls are filled with soft mush, horrible!!!! don't waste your time/money.......\n",
