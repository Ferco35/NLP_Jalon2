            "OK, just got home from a \"birthday\" dinner for my son at the Burlington location. Quick synopsis; he is in the kitchen eating leftover homemade pasta since after two tries, at a steak dinner, they couldn't do it correctly!\n",

            "Details, you want details, here goes...\n",
            " Made a reservation for this evening at 530, making sure to mention that it was a birthday dinner for my son who's turning 17 ( and who has eaten some of the best {& most expensive steaks around...much to my chagrin]) this week. Walked in an was taken to a table that was literally, I think (my first time there, so I'm not 100% certain) the absolute worst one in the room! Told hostess that it wasn't going to work and after some awkward time waiting was taken to a much nicer one. Was offered no apology, but OK, we're on to a nice meal now. Waitress was great, apps were good and after a comfortable, if not a tad lengthy period, dinners arrived. Now for a $44 steak (bone-in Rib-Eye), I must say it was visually appealing, with the bone hanging over the plate by 10 or so inches. The appealing part stops there though! He took a bite or two and I could tell he wasn't happy. He passed a bite or two over and could see why. It wasn't anything what we were expecting. His comment was that he's had better at the 99. I must say, I would have to agree with him ( as did my wife & daughter). When the waitress came over to check on us, we all said our 3 meals were great, but the steak was not one worth anywhere near what we were paying. They offered to get him another meal, and he chose the Filet. By the time the manager (I think it was the manager, she never told us who she was) brought over the new steak, we were done with our meals, so we all held our breath while he cut into the new steak. After ordering two steaks medium, well, I guess you're not going to fall off your chairs when you hear that the outside was nicely charred, while the inside was raw! At that point, he had had enough! Check please! \n",
            "\n",
            " Now, on the plus side, we weren't charged for any steak. We still managed to spend $125 (before tip, which I didn't skimp on because it wasn't the waitresses fault) on the rest of our meals, with a couple of glasses of VERY nice wine. I just feel that at that price level, we were cheated out of my sons birthday dinner and with so many other options in the area, at this level of (supposed) quality(?), there's really no sense in taking a chance going here. Not sure I'd ever go back! Too bad, since it's very convenient for us.\n",
            "\n",
            "UPDATE! - Just wanted to add that I've never heard one word back from the restaurant. After this entry, along with one on their website, not one word. Guess they don't care!\n",

            "\n",
            "Thumbs down for me.\n",
            "NOT authentic!!! Looks pretty but doesn't taste great! Everything lacked Spanish flavor and needed salt we ordered a Cuban, beef arepa, and the roasted pork with boiled yuca white rice and red beans. The sauces they offered were disappointing and flavorless as well. Although the staff was very nice and helpful. FYI you order and then sit down nice atmosphere. Won't be back I like my Spanish food authentic. Good for people that like Spanish food but don't have Spanish mothers.\n",

            "well wanted to give Krystal's another chance, what a big mistake. I order the breakfast plate and everything was wrong... wrong type of eggs, grit when I order Crispers, and a burnt biscuit, when I ordered toast. the manager (Mary) acted like I was burdened and wouldn't even talk to me. she blew me off and walked away. the radio was so loud that we could talk in the store with out shouting. again a went up and ask to speak to the manager and was told sorry corporate controls the music and there is nothing they can do. as of Monday Krystal's lost six long time breakfast club members who will go to steal and shake.\n",
            "sorry. never again. I use to come here often because we live in the neighborhood, but my girlfriend got a sandwich there one day, and we discovered mold on the cheese. never again will I come back here. As a microbiology major, mold on hard cheeses like that run the risk of listeria, brucella, salmonella and E. coli. how long was that cheese open? it has to be refrigerated when not in use right? I have the same cheese in my refrigerator that i have had for three weeks and it doesn't have any mold on it. makes me wonder what the bakery looks like. \n",

            "I would love to try the food, however I can't get them to answer the phone. Today, their phone was off for two hours, and when they finally answered, I was told they wouldn't be delivering. They probably have delicious food, but I can already tell they have terrible customer service. \n",
            "Seeing as my entire work experience has centered around customer service, I find it somewhat insulting to have a restaurant rely souly on the quality of their food, and have complete disregard for their customer service.\n",
            "My fiance and I went here today and what was supposed to be a nice day out turned into me lying in bed thinking if I should go to the hospital. The waitress was very nice and the food was fine, nothing too special, but roughly an hour after eating I began feeling ill. I went to a nearby restroom and almost passed out from pain and had all the usual gross symptoms of food poisoning.  My fiance had to bring the car around to grab me and rush me home. After getting back he called the restaraunt to let them know what dish it was if in case they found a pattern in people saying something about the food. The manager got immediately defensive, saying that my being sick was all in my head and that it takes more time than that to get food poisoning.  We were shocked at how rude and unprofessional management was. It was either the food, which would be the obvious conclusion, or the orchid flower they place right in the middle of the plate, which our waitress even admitted they wash and reuse them through out the day. That already was a red flag. I definitely will not be coming back here and would not recommend anyone go and risk getting sick; you'll get no sympathy from their management.\n",
            "I called them to order delivery and this rude girl Ariel answered; she seemed like I was bothering her. She put me on hold then after 2 min waiting, I got hung up on. \n",

            "I called back 4 times and no one answered! It made zero sense. I waited 5 min then called back just to see if someone would answer. Ariel answered again. I was like \"you hung up on me\". She said it was the phone... \n",

            "Then asked if I \"wanted to order something or...\" But couldn't hear me because an employee around her was loud. So after correcting my address like 6 or 7 times, I finally got my order in and she said okay it'll be this much then said and 30-45 min then hung up. \n",
